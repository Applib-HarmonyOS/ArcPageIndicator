Bored of the usual small points or stressed by the space occupied by a tab bar?<br>
Try this elevator-like elegant and original page indicator!
A fully customizable super-easy Page Indicator, with stunning animations and very original and discreet graphics, for HarmonyOS. Needs a very small screen, perfect when many pages need to be shown and reached in a small time.

### Some maths
<a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2093569/points-on-an-ellipse">This question Mr. Beppi Menozzi made</a> helped him solve the
ellipse's problem. Indeed, finding arcs of constant length on a known ellipse is a problem with a non-finite solution, that needs integrals to be calculated. There were at least 5 approaches to solve this problem with acceptable performance:

* find the points recursively, by iteratively reducing the error until it's close enough to zero. Pros: easy to do. Cons: adds a indetermined (although very small) time to the drawing process
* create a big table of sampled data and storing them to provide a database of pre-calculated solutions. Pros: fastest. Cons: can't work for *any* number of elements
* distribute the points on the radius and project them on the circumference. Pros: very fast. Cons: error still pretty large
* use an approximated function. Pros: fast and good enough. Cons: never perfect
* calculate the elliptic integrals. Pros: perfect. Cons: very very very heavy on performance

He chose to find a good approximated function and that is what you can find inside the code, it's fast enough and the error is near to invisibility. In case you need more performance, you can remove the e6 part of the formula and have a slightly bigger error.

The formula used is the one of the referenced question, and thanks very much to its author, <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/users/299599/ng-chung-tak">Ng Chung Tak</a> that is both the author of the answer, and the author of the formula itself.
